### Features for future versions

1. User should not be able to add self to crew X days before race event--at all, or with owner's authorization?

2. User can remove self from crew up to day of race event, and removal requires email (e.g.) notification to owner of crew change

3. User should not be able to automatically add self to crew: User should instead be able to 'wishlist' as crew, and the owner will be required to 'add' wishlisted users to official crew for race event (prevents owner from having a crew larger than desired based on race conditions (e.g.)).

4. User should only be able to add self to a crew position that is also in their profile (e.g., can't add self as main trimmer unless that ability in already listed in user's profile) and/or app should prompt user to update profile at same time.
